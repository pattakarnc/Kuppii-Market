Online Shopping Application
## Project Description
In this project, I'm planning to build a simple online shopping application using the materials and knowledge I've learned throughout the course. 
The app will be constructed based on the CRUD model which I believe is the most memorable framework to build a full, usable web-application.
## Key features
In order to enter the website, a user must first login or create a new account if he/she does not have one. Similar to what I've implemented in class,the website allows user to grab an item, put it in the shopping cart, and calculate the total price automatically.
## Optional features
If possible, I would like to make the user able to search for a specific item as well as filtering the results by category, price, and so on. As well, an implementation of a booking system is considered to be made if I've enough time.
